Node Bootstrap is a project skeleton for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 0.6.x+ and [Express.js](http://expressjs.com)
development with Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) (no pun intended) framework.

Project skeleton provides: common node.js webapp layout for responsive web development, suggests some common Node
modules and best-practices, as well as provides two convenient shell scripts:

* dev_start.sh will start your server.js node app in single-CPU mode with hot-realoading of code enabled.
* start.sh will start your server.js without hot-reloading, but with as many child processes as you have CPU cores.

By default, dev_start.sh also lets Express.js handle static files so you don't have to have a web server. The production
version: start.sh assumes you want your web-server (Nginx?) to take on this job.

## Compatibility

We try to keep Node Bootstrap updated with the latest versions of Node, Express and Bootstrap. In some cases, where it
makes sense, branches compatible with older versions are created: https://github.com/inadarei/nodebootstrap/branches to
make upgrade path a little smoother.

## Quick Test:

Assuming you already have node and npm installed (If not: 
[this blog post](http://freshblurbs.com/install-node-js-and-express-js-nginx-debian-lenny) can help on Debian/Ubuntu
and you can figure out similar steps, with the help of [HomeBrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) on Mac):

    > npm install supervisor -g
    > npm install
    > chmod u+x dev_start.sh
    > ./dev_start.sh

You should see a simple "hello" at: http://localhost:3000/hello.
You can customize it by visiting http://localhost:3000/hello?name=yourname but really what you should probably do
instead is dive into the code and see how it is put together.

## Contextualizing Runtime Environment

Following environmental variables can affect the runtime behavior and startup mode:

* NODE_LAUNCH_SCRIPT - defaults to "server.js"
* NODE_ENV - defaults to "production"
* NODE_CLUSTERED - defaults to 1 (on)
* NODE_HOT_RELOAD - defaults to 0 (off)
* NODE_SERVE_STATIC - defaults to 0 (off) - in production you should serve static content with NginX, not: Node.
* NODE_CONFIG_DIR - defaults to "config" folder in the current folder
* NODE_LOG_DIR - defaults to "logs" folder in the current folder

## Hot Reloading vs. Daemon-izing Script.

In production environments it is a good idea to daemon-ize your Node process using Forever.js. Forever will restart
the process if it accidentally crashes.

In development, it is much more important to have "hot-reloading" of code available. This feature can be provided
with Supervisor.js package. If you set NODE_HOT_RELOAD to 1, start.sh will run in hot-reloading mode watching your
main script, libs folder and config folder.

Unfortunately, Supervisor and Forever packages do not work nicely with each other, so you can only use one
or the other, at this point. Setting NODE_HOT_RELOAD to 1 disables backgrounding of your script and runs your Node
application in foreground (which, to be fair, in most cases, is what you probably want during development, anyway).


## Customization:

It's not a bad idea to use more expressive name than default server.js for your main script. If you run multiple 
scripts on the server it can really help differentiate between various forever or "ps" processes. However, if you
do rename server.js, please make sure to also update corresponding lines in start.sh script.

Most of the launch logic is located in start.sh. By looking at dev_start.sh you can see that it is just altering
some environmental variables. Following this pattern you can easily create launch scripts for other environments
e.g. stage_start.sh, if needed.
