Node Bootstrap is a project skeleton for Node.js 6.x development with Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) (no pun intended)
framework.

Project skeleton provides: common node.js webapp layout for responsive web development, suggests some common Node
modules and best-practices, as well as provides two convenient shell scripts:

* start_dev.sh will start your server.js node app in single-CPU mode with hot-realoading of code enabled.
* start.sh will start your server.js without hot-reloading, but with as many child processes as you have CPU cores.

By default, start_dev.sh also lets Express.js handle static files so you don't have to have a web server. The production
version: start.sh assumes you want your web-server (Nginx?) to take on this job.

Project is still in its infancy. Please use issue queue to submit any bug fixes or suggestions.

## Quick Test:

Assuming you already have node and npm installed (If not: 
[this blog post](http://freshblurbs.com/install-node-js-and-express-js-nginx-debian-lenny) can help on Debian/Ubuntu
and you can figure out similar steps, with the help of [HomeBrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) on Mac):

    > npm install
    > chmod u+x start_dev.sh
    > ./start_dev.sh

You should see a simple "hello" at: http://localhost:9000/hello. 
You can customize it by visting http://localhost:9000/hello?name=yourname but really what you should probably do
instead is dive into the code and see how it is put together.
